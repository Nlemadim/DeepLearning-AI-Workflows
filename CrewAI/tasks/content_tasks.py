Content Tools Module
===================

This module manages the creation and organization of tools for CrewAI agents.

Tool Assignment Hierarchy:
-------------------------

Tools in CrewAI can be assigned at two levels:

1. Agent Level:
   - Tools assigned directly to an agent are available for all tasks
   - The agent has discretionary use of these tools
   
2. Task Level:
   - Tools assigned to specific tasks override agent-level tools
   - When a task has assigned tools, the agent will ONLY use those tools
   - This provides precise control over tool usage for specific tasks

Visual Representation:
---------------------

                     Assigning Tools
                     
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │    Tools     │
                    └──────┬───────┘
                           │
                 ┌────────┴────────┐
                 │                  │
        ┌────────┴───────┐    ┌────┴────┐
        │     Agent      │    │  Task   │
        │   (Default)    │    │(Override)│
        └────────────────┘    └─────────┘

Notes:
- Tools assigned to Agent: Available for all tasks (discretionary use)
- Tools assigned to Task: Exclusively used for that specific task
